YOUR FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM
In computer science, we have a tradition where we
introduce students to a language by showing them how
to print "Hello World".

BTW, everything written here is called a comment.
Comments are sections of text that we write to explain
things to ourselves (or other programmers).  The computer
ignores these lines, and only executes the code (below).

print("hello world!")
